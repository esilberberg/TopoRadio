                    <p>The United States is the second largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. Spanish sustains cultural elements of both immigrant and US Latinx communities.  It has been spoken in the United States before the territory and its people were colonized by English-speaking Europeans (Rosina Lozano, <i>An American Language: The History of Spanish in the United States</i>, 2018).</p>
                    <p>In its effort to bridge the gap between academia and Spanish-speaking communities across the United States, members of the Spanish-language Radio Caucus of the Radio Preservation Task Force (RPTF) study, promote, disseminate and publish aural, digital, and scholarly work on radio among Latinx communities across the nation.</p>
                    <p>This pioneering visualization project is a point of departure for the work scholars, librarians, archivists, broadcasters, and public radio personnel committed to when the RPTF was formed in 2014. TopoRadio is a vital and necessary next step in the effort to identify and map public, archival, and scholarly resources. It offers us the opportunity to ask critical questions about Spanish-language and bilingual broadcasting. In doing so, TopoRadio also brings attention to rich media histories and how Spanish-dominant listeners have transformed radio into today’s popular format. We hope this site sparks new debates and understandings of our media relationships across the United States.</p>
